Spring is a DEPENDENCY INJECTION FRAMEWORK.
Spring Framework help to create loosley coupled applications.

Beans - the instance of objects that are managed by Spring.

Autowiring - the process of identifying dependencies and populating them.

IOC Container - includes everything what implements Inversion Of Control.  In Spring it's the Application Context.

1. What is inversion of control
IOC - is the mechanism which is related to how dependencies are
handed to target class. Target class doesn't manage it dependencies,
all the dependencies are managed by bean container (Spring fore
example). Dependencies some from outside. In this way it's easy
to test suche code, to replace the implementations, to have less
coupling, to program with interfaces etc.

2. Dependency injection is a design pattern - the implementation of
IOC. It resolved dependencies using spring container. Container of
beans. Dependency injection allows to comply single responsobility principle
and IOC principle.

3. How to inject bean:
- constructor based
- setter based (if we want to have kind of optional dependency)
- field based

4. Mode of autowiring:
- by Type
- constructor (the same as By Type but constructor is used)
- by Name (setter method, name of field should be the same as name of bean in xml or class name itself)
